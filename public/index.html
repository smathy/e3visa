    <p><img border="0" src="images/dearfriend.png" width="250" height="75"></p>
    <p>Have you always dreamed of making that <b><u>BIG</u></b> change to your 
    life? Planning to move to United States to reach your <b>ultimate dreams</b>?</p>
    <p>How would you like to take weekends way to visit those places you&#39;ve 
    always wanted to see? Can you imagine being the neighbour of some 
    world-famous celebrities in Hollywood?</p>
    <p>Just imagine standing at the base of the Statue of Liberty, riding the 
    elevator up the Empire State Building, or exploring Central Park. Can you 
    feel the excitement?</p>
    <p><b>It&#39;s fantastic, Mate!</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="images/family_statueliberty1.jpg" width="626" height="347"></p>
    <p>The United States of America (also called the United States, the US, the 
    USA, America, and the States) is indeed a major country of the world.</p>
    <p>It is one of the <b>world&#39;s most ethnically diverse</b> and <b>
    multicultural nations</b>, the product of large-scale immigration from many 
    countries. The US economy is the world&#39;s largest national economy, with an 
    estimated 2010 GDP of $14.53 trillion.</p>
    <p>Moving to America is a pretty big step to anyone. It can be fun. Heck, it 
    should be fun! But sometimes, it may seem <b><u>very</u></b> <b><u>
    intimidating</u></b> -- especially to those who wish to stay <b>permanently</b> 
    -- because there are so many factors to be considered.</p>
    <p>There will be questions like...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you really afford it?</li>
      <li>Can you fit into the US fast pace lifestyle?</li>
      <li>Are there tips tailored to my situation?</li>
      <li>Is a certain city my only living option?</li>
      <li>What steps should I take with my move to the US?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    One day you may be stressed about your visa options. But a visa is useless 
    if you can&#39;t find a job, a place to stay and can&#39;t open a bank account. This 
    common immigrant&#39;s situation is far more <b>stressful</b>.<br>
    <br>
    Also, have you considered how much time and money you&#39;ll be putting in to 
    your move to the US? Yes, the numbers can be frightening.</p>
    <p>
    Allow me to introduce myself...</p>
    <p>
    My name is [<font color="#FF0000">FULL NAME</font>].
    My family and I moved to California from Sydney two years ago and not a day 
    goes by that we are not <b>thankful</b> that we are here. For someone who is 
    considering taking this step, I can without hesitation say that we have not 
    had any regrets.</p>
    <p>
    And today, I have the <b>perfect solution</b> for you and your family...</p>
    <p>
    You see,
    I have written a guidebook. An ebook, to be exact (in this time and age, where 
    documents can be sent electronically to another continent in seconds, why 
    not we save a couple of trees?).</p>
    <p>
    This is a guidebook about finding the right answers to <u>ALL</u> your 
    questions...</p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="images/text_04.png" width="720" height="208"></p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="images/bookcover1.jpg" width="400" height="671"></p>
    <p>
    This is your <b>ultimate guide</b> 
    for asking, getting, and making the most of your &quot;moving to USA&quot; experiences.</p>
    <p>
    With this guide, you can take the uncertainty, risks, stress and confusion 
    out of your move to the USA. This is the single biggest source of helpful 
    and useful information that you&#39;re going to find in your quest to move to 
    America -- guaranteed.<br>
    <br>
    Would you go on a long, difficult and important road trip without a map? Of 
    course you wouldn&#39;t, because the cost of failure is just too great.<br>
    <br>
    Why not have a <b>detailed</b> and <b>accurate</b> US immigration map? A map 
    that shows you the way <b>from start to finish</b>. A map that tells you 
    what you should do and when.<br>
    <br>
    A map that lets you know where there is danger as well as opportunity. A map 
    that provides a solution to every US immigration problem.<br>
    <br>
    Sure you can get involved with immigration advisors, lawyers and relocation 
    agents, but they <b>charge thousands of dollars</b> for information that you 
    can get right here, right now. The days of innocent, uninformed migrants 
    being ripped off have now come to an end - but only for someone like you who 
    knows about this guide.<br>
    <br>
    A guide that many people wished existed before they moved over rather than 
    having to learn everything the hard and expensive way.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;<b>Moving To The USA</b>&quot; equips you with the <u>knowledge</u> and <u>
    skills</u> you need to emigrate to and successfully settle in any part of 
    the United States. Whether it be Washington, New York, Los Angeles or Las 
    Vegas, the system is the same.<br>
    <br>
    With this guide you get more than the &quot;what to do&quot;, but most importantly, 
    you get the &quot;how, when, where, who and why&quot; of emigrating to the States. </p>
    <p>
    Inside this guidebook, you will discover the answers to questions like...</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Which US visa do you qualify for?</b><br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>What&#39;s the best way to organise yourself before leaving for the UK?<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li><b>How to buy a house the right way?</b><br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Are there things you can do now to make things easier for yourself?<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li><b>How do you go about finding a job?</b> How can you gauge your job 
      prospects?<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>How to open your own bank account?<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li><b>What is the true cost of living there? What to expect?</b><br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>And many, many more!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Yes, there have been hurdles, differences and frustrations, which is the 
    reason I am writing this guidebook. Had I known two years ago all the things I 
    know now or simply been able to ask someone a question, the move would have 
    been even <b>a lot easier</b> and I would have saved <b>a lot of time</b>.</p>

    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    Hey, that&#39;s a good question.</p>
    <p>
    But, allow me to rephrase it for you...</p>
    <p>
    <b>&quot;How much this guidebook will help you change your life?&quot;</b></p>
    <p>
    Think about how much the information will help you save thousands of 
    dollars... Think about how much the information will help you save enormous 
    time and headaches while you&#39;re in the US -- headaches that can go on for 
    years!</p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="images/headache.jpg" width="500" height="301"></p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    You don&#39;t want that, do you?</p>
    <p>
    Moving to another country can be tough, I know that, but you have me on your 
    side. You can hold my hands and I will take you there... to United States!</p>
    <p>
    I will walk you through one step at a time, so you can have an <b>enjoyable 
    experience</b>, and an interesting story to <b>share with your grandchildren!</b></p>
    <p>
    <b>Why isn&#39;t this all free, you ask?</b><br>
    <br>
    Why charge a price for information in the &#39;Information Age&#39; where most things 
    are free? Well, this work is of value, whilst what is often freely available on 
    the Internet isn&#39;t really of value.  </p>
    <p>
    Restricting yourself to &quot;free&quot; information 
    means you&#39;re equipping yourself to compete with the hordes of people who 
    have the same free information. I believe <u>better</u> <u>knowledge</u> can only ever lead to 
    superior results.<br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, something gained for free is often not appreciated and ends up 
    being discarded. It would also be cruel and wrong to get people without 
    money excited about the prospect of a better life. Also, my time is of value 
    and it&#39;s only <u>fair</u> that I get something back for my time spent constantly 
    updating the guide, administering this site and answering emails.</p>
    <p>
    <b>How does the payment process work?</b><br>
    <br>
    When you click on a payment link, you&#39;ll be redirected to a secure page 
    where you enter your credit or debit card details. This service, provided by 
    the e-commerce giants, PayPal and Clickbank, uses the latest 128-bit 
    patented security technology which would take all the computers in America 
    running continuously for 4,000 years to crack. It also allows for a smooth, 
    quick and safe transaction. I don&#39;t get to see your card details and neither 
    does anyone at PayPal or ClickBank. Their computers delete the few details 
    you give after 24 hours.<br>
    <br>
    When making payment, please note: Your card &quot;validation code&quot; is the 3 
    numbers after your card number on the magnetic strip on the back of the 
    card.<br>
    <br>
    Once you&#39;ve entered your details, these will be verified. Upon successful 
    completion, a download page will appear. On this page, you can download the 
    guidebook in PDF format along with the free bonuses.<br>
    <br>
    The whole process should take <b>less than 3 minutes</b>.<br>
    <br>
    There is no waiting for snail mail delivery, for things going missing or 
    shipping charges involved. If you have any questions about the guide or this 
    site, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:sinead@website.com">
    sinead@website.com</a>.</p>
    <p>
    Not comfortable yet?</p>
    <p>
    All right then, allow me to remove any risk that you might face. If youâre still 
sitting on the fence, let me tell you that <b>you have nothing to lose.</b></p>
<p>Order a copy of &quot;<i>Moving To The USA</i>&quot; right now and read it through, from start to 
finish. And please, take your time. No need to rush. If you don&#39;t like what you 
see, then all you have to do is send me an email so I can refund your money.</p>
<p><b>No gimmicks. No lies. No worries.</b><br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img border="0" src="images/guarantee_certificate.png" width="605" height="455"></p>
<p>And guess what... you even get to keep the guidebook should you be refunded!<br>
<br>
So basically, the risk is all mine. I&#39;ve put time and effort in to writing the guide, 
managing this website, etc. If you don&#39;t like the guide, you get your money back 
and I lose all my time and effort. I&#39;ll keep losing if my guide is rubbish.</p>
<p>But 
it isn&#39;t, so we&#39;re both happy.<br>
<br>
My friends even say that one of chapters alone is worth several times more 
than the asking price!</p>
<p>And don&#39;t think of this guide as a mere ebook. Remember instead that 
    you are benefiting from <b>proven</b> <b>knowledge</b> and
<b>effective</b> <b>solutions</b> to a myriad 
    of common problems that you <b><u>WILL</u></b> most definitely encounter in 
the US.</p>
<p>There is no beating around the bush or hard sell with this 49-page guidebook. 
If you have got this far, then clearly there is something bugging you...</p>
<p>There is something that you just have to know right now, am I correct?</p>
<p>Then, what are you waiting for?</p>
<p> <b>Get yourself a copy of &quot;Moving To The USA&quot; right now -- the price is </b>
